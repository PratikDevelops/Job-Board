# Job Board Project

## Overview
The Job Board project is a fully functional web application designed to help job seekers find job openings and apply directly through the platform. The application is built with a clean and modern design, providing users with a seamless experience for discovering, searching, and applying for jobs. With user authentication through email/password and Google Sign-In, job seekers can easily create an account, log in, and start exploring the listings.

The project utilizes React.js for the frontend and Firebase for authentication and storage. The app is fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across all screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Features
- Job Listings: A list of available job openings with detailed information about each job, including the title, company name, job location, description, and more.
- Search & Filter: Easily search and filter jobs by job title, location, or job type.
- User Authentication: Secure login and sign-up using email/password or Google Sign-In.
- Responsive Design: Optimized user interface for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Job Applications: Directly apply for jobs through the platform.
- Google Sign-In: A faster and easier way to log in using your Google account.
- Job Details: View detailed information about each job listing, including responsibilities, requirements, and salary range.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication (Email/Password and Google Sign-In)
- Database: Firebase Firestore (for storing job listings)
- Styling: CSS3, Flexbox, and CSS Grid for responsive design
- Deployment: Firebase Hosting, Netlify, or Vercel (choose based on your preference)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js: Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm: npm is automatically installed with Node.js.

### Steps to Install and Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PratikDevelops/job-board-project.git
   cd job-board-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup**:
   - Create a project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable **Firebase Authentication** (Email/Password & Google Sign-In) and Firestore for job data.
   - Create a file `src/firebase/firebaseConfig.js` and add your Firebase credentials (you can get these from the Firebase console).


   ```javascript
   // src/firebase/firebaseConfig.js
   import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
   import { getAuth, GoogleAuthProvider } from 'firebase/auth';
   import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
     authDomain: 'YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN',
     projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID',
     storageBucket: 'YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET',
     messagingSenderId: 'YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID',
     appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
     measurementId: 'YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID',
   };

   const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   const auth = getAuth(app);
   const googleProvider = new GoogleAuthProvider();
   const firestore = getFirestore(app);

   export { auth, googleProvider, firestore };
   ```


4. **Start the app**:
   Now that everything is set up, run the following command to start the app locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:

### 1. Firebase Authentication Issues:
   - If you're encountering authentication errors, make sure Firebase Authentication is set up correctly and that the email/password or Google Sign-In method is enabled in the Firebase Console.

### 2. App Not Loading or API Errors:
   - Ensure you have run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
   - Check the browser console for any error messages and address them accordingly.

### 3. Google Sign-In Not Working:
   - Verify that your Firebase credentials in the `firebaseConfig.js` file are correct and match the ones from your Firebase project.
   - Ensure you have enabled Google Sign-In under the Authentication tab in Firebase.
